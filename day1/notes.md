# 📘 Day 1 — What is Kubernetes?

Welcome to **Day 1** of the *"Learn Kubernetes Day by Day"* series!

If you're new to Kubernetes or cloud-native development, this series will help you build a solid foundation with **daily hands-on explanations** and real-world examples.

---

## 🧠 What is Kubernetes?

**Kubernetes** (also called **K8s**) is an open-source **container orchestration platform**.

It helps you:

- Run and manage **containers** at scale  
- Handle **automated deployment**, **scaling**, and **recovery**  
- Organize your application into **pods, services, and workloads**  
- Deploy across **cloud**, **on-prem**, or **local** environments

Originally developed at Google, Kubernetes is now maintained by the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)** and used by companies of all sizes around the world.

## 🏗️ Why Use Kubernetes?

### ✅ Key Benefits:

- **Automation**: Rollouts, rollbacks, scheduling, and self-healing
- **Scalability**: Scale apps up/down based on demand
- **Portability**: Run your workloads anywhere (AWS, Azure, GCP, on-prem…)
- **Declarative configuration**: Infrastructure as Code with YAML
- **Ecosystem**: Built-in tools, add-ons, and integrations (monitoring, security, etc.)

## 🔍 Core Concepts to Understand

Here's what you'll encounter throughout this series:

- **Pods**: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes (usually a container)
- **Nodes**: Machines (VMs or physical) that run your workloads
- **Clusters**: A group of nodes managed by Kubernetes
- **Services**: Abstractions to expose your apps internally or externally
- **Deployments**: Manage and roll out application versions
- **Namespaces**: Logical separation of resources in your cluster
